# Inception v3
Inception v3 in Keras: Reimplementation of Inception-v3 official tensorflow version.


### Disclaimer

This is a re-implementation of original Inception-v3 which is based on tensorflow. The official repository is available [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/slim/inception_model.py)

The arxiv paper **Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision** is avaiable [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567.pdf).

#### Usage
You can run `main.py` to see usage of Inception-v3.
```
cd /path/to/inception
python main.py
```

* `main.py` is a naive script to classify CIFAR-10 using Inception v3.
